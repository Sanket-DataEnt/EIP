### Questions and Answers:

Q1. What is Covolution?
A : Convolution is the process of multiplying two matrix of same dimension but different size to produce another matrix of same dimension.


Q2. What is Filters/ Kernels?
A : A kernel is a filter to extract a unique feature from the image.


Q3. What is Epochs?
A : Epoch defines as a cycle in which complete data is trained once with the help of backward and forward 		propogation.


Q4. What is 1x1 convolution?
A : 1x1 convolution acts as a filter of size 1x1. It is also used for dimension reduction for the previous 		layer.


Q5. What is 3x3 convolution?
A : 3x3 convolution reduces the size of the image slightly if we use it without padding. If 3x3 kernel is 		used on image of 28x28 pixels the output feature map will be of size 26x26.


Q6. What is Feature Maps?
A : It is the collection of features. It is also called kernel or feature extractor.


Q7. What is Activation function?
A : It is used to add non-linearity in the network.


Q8. What is Receptive Field?
A : Receptive Field is the segment of the image that is clearly visible from one kernel at that time.
