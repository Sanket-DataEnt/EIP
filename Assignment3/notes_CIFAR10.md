# Result of the Assignment


### Achieved 84.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataset with using 99,653 parameters. I have used Dropout and Augementation to do regularisation which helped in reducing overfitting. Furthermore, I have also used BatchNormalisation to reduce Internal Covariate Shift effect. As a optimiser, I have used ADAM. Output and Receptive Field of each convolution is clearly mentioned against each step in final code which gave validation accuracy of 84.2%. Moreover, there are more chances of improvement in validation accuracy, which I will do in further notebooks.
